#Ruby Inventory:
#The user can add or remove items
#The user can set the current number of items
#The user can print out a table structure
#The user can zero out an item

#The user cannot put in nonsensical data: -1 bananas
#When you start the program it gives a list of all the options

#Create a github repository for this and push your code and itâ€™s updates to it.
